# AR
An ARapp designed for EFL teaching
It is an AR app that will help students actually cope with the content, concepts and tasks that are presented in unit 7 of the Book 2 for EFL in Lyceums in Greece. It uses images from certain parts of the text book, creates a data base with them in Yuforia. Then I use the Unity engine to create the app. I will use the AR component of Unity. The images in Yuforia will be ranked according to their status as target-images. They will receive a ranking pictured in stars, the more the stars the easier they are to be Augmented. Augmentation makes use of a smart phone's camera. Each image the camera senses, is compared to the ones stored in Vuforia. When the algorithme matches one with the ones in the database, the video or image will be placed on top of the target image when the camera is viewing it. By checking the pages in their text book, I need to point to the appropriate page and section. Students can point their camera phones, detect the image, compare it with the database in Vuforia, hit a match and the content becomes alive! The content is mainly suggestedby the Institute of Educational Politics and the answers to all the tasks were also added.
